# AnalyticsTest
This was a testproject I made at the beginning of an internship to experiment with analytics and creating something from scratch.

This was a project where you got a UUID when connecting to a website. This UUID was used to check the route you took through the site and what personal information was filled in during the interaction on the website. It also checked how long products on a certain page where viewed and had a dashboard on which you could check all the statistics and filter them by date.
